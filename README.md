## Live classification of handwritten digits

#### Contributors (in alaphabetical order): Fabian Hoppe, Christoph Kehle, Sebastian Lunz

This will be a basic neural network to classify handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). This project is part of a one-week summer academy about 'convex optimisation' organised by the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/) at [Kloster Roggenburg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kloster_Roggenburg).

* Using a logistic regression we have trained our code to classify handwritten digits.
* We have connected the webcam and phone camera to our computer to read in live images. After some segmentation steps, the image can be classified by the trained algorithm.
